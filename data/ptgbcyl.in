This is a parameter file for program gbcyl/coarsemc. Format is as follows:

1. Parameter lines start with a $ followed by the parameter name or 'key'. 

2. The value of the  parameter must be separated from the key by whitespace. 

3. Parameter lines may be 80 characters long. 
3.1. The first 30 characters on the line are used for key. 
3.1.1. The whitespace before the value is included in the length. 
3.2. Next 50 characters on the same line can be used for the parameter value. 

4. Lines not starting with $ can be used for comments. 

5. Comments may also be placed after a parameter value by adding some 
whitespace after the value. Reduced units are used unless mentioned otherwise.


MC engine parameters:
$isopenmp F

$is_wall_on F

$scaling_type "z,xy"

$n_equilibration_sweeps		10        	
$n_production_sweeps		10     	
$production_period		2         	Number of sweeps between writing
						configurations to disk.
$move_adjusting_period		10		
$pt_adjusting_period            100

MC sweep parameters:
$pt_ratio			1000		(Approximate) number of particle
						moves between parallel 
						tempering swaps.
$move_ratio			0.33            The desired ratio with which
						particle moves are accepted.
$scaling_ratio   		0.25		The desired ratio with which
						volume moves are accepted.
$max_translation		0.1		Initial maximum translation for
						a particle
$max_rotation			0.045458	Initial maximum rotation angle
						for a particle (radians). 
$pressure           		2.0         	
$temperature			2.0		

$max_scaling			0.001		Maximum amount of scaling of the 
						simulation box. This can be two
						times the maximum translation.
						
$seed				432512 		Random number generator seed.


Pair potential parameters:
$r_cutoff			5.5		


Gay-Berne -potential parameters:
$gb_kappa_sigma			4.4		
$gb_kappa_epsilon		20.0		
$gb_mu				1.0
$gb_nu				1.0
$gb_sigma_0			1.0
$gb_epsilon_0			1.0



Polyneighbourlist parameters:


Neighbourlist type can be either verletlist or celllist.

$nbrlisttype			verletlist



Cell list parameters:


$isdivisioneven			F

Option for even number of cells in each direction is to be used for making 
particle moves parallel in non-adjacent cells. Note: division probably doesn't 
have to be even in non-periodic directions!


$cellminlength			6.5		

cellminlength > r_cutoff + 2 * max_translation. Here we assume that 
max_translation won't be adjusted over 0.5 and the cell list is updated after 
succesful volume scaling, after succesful swap of configurations and after 
moving all the particles in sequence. 



Verlet list and pair potential parameters

$r_list				6.8		
$largest_translation 		0.22		
$max_nneighbours		500


Wall-particle-interaction parameters:
$is_uniform_alignment		F		
$Kw				8.0		Relative strength of the 
						particle-wall interaction
						Kw = 8 equals approximately to
						maximum (minimum) of GB-GB 
						interaction.
