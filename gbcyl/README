This is ptgbcyl A parallel-tempering, constant NPT Metropolis Monte Carlo 
simulation program for a bulk Gay-Berne (GB) liquid crystal or one confined in
a cylindrical cavity.

The copyright belongs to Jouni Karjalainen for most of the code but there are
routines some modules and subroutines that have different copyright ownership.
Where appropriate, these are documented in the source files. 

Compiling
---------

This example is assuming that a bourne shell eg. bash is used. mpi_lib_path
should be the stuff after -L when giving the command mpif90 -show. Here we 
assume that the name of the fortran compiler wrapper including the mpi 
directories is mpif90. LD_LIBRARY_PATH may have to be set to pass the compiler
tests made by the configure script. 

Give the following commands in the shell. To see more options use command
./configure --help

FC=mpif90
./configure --prefix=yourinstallationpath [FCFLAGS=your compiler options]
make 
make install

The executables should be now installed to yourinstallationpath/bin/
Example parameter file gbcyl.in and example starting configurations have been 
installed to yourinstallationpath/share/

When using interprocedural optimization you may have to compile the mt_stream
library first without it by going to the mt_stream-1.11 folder and giving the command
make FCFLAGS=[your options without the interprocedural optimization option]


Usage
-----

A new simulation:

You need the following files:
1. program binary: ptgbcyl (default)
2. parameter files for each cpu: inputparameters.0, inputparameters.1, ...  
3. file to read the starting configuration for each cpu: inputconfiguration.0, inputconfiguration.1, ...

Copy parameter file and starting configuration to the directory where you want 
to run the program and have the program output files.

Example of running with 8 cores. The specific way to run to program will 
probably depend on the computer you are working at

mpirun -np 8 ./ptgbcyl


The program will periodically output restartparameters.0, restartparameters.1,
... and restartconfigurations.0, restartconfigurations.1,... You can replace the 
corresponding input files with these to e.g. restart an interrupted simulation.
