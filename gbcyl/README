This is ptgbcyl A Parallel-tempering, constant NPT Metropolis Monte Carlo 
simulation program for a Gay-Berne liquid crystal in a cylindrical mesocavity.
The copyright belongs to Jouni Karjalainen for most of the code but there are
routines some modules and subroutines that have different copyright ownership.


Compiling
---------

This example is assuming that a bourne shell eg. bash is used. mpi_lib_path
should be the stuff after -L when giving the command mpif90 -show. Here we 
assume that the name of the fortran compiler wrapper including the mpi 
directories is mpif90. LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set to pass the compiler
tests made by the configure script. 

Give the following commands in the shell. To see more options use command
./configure --help

FC=mpif90
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=mpi_lib_path:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure --prefix=yourinstallationpath 
make 
make install

The executable should be now installed to yourinstallationpath/bin/
Example parameter file gbcyl.in and example starting configurations have been 
installed to yourinstallationpath/share/


Usage
-----

A new simulation:

You need the following files:
1. program binary: ptgbcyl (default)
2. parameter files for each cpu: fin-kgb.0.pms, fin-kgb.1.pms, ...  
3. file to read the starting configuration for each cpu: fin-kgb.0.mol, fin-kgb.1.mol, ...

Copy parameter file and starting configuration to the directory where you want 
to run the program and have the program output files.

Running with 8 cores:
mpirun -np 8 ./ptgbcyl

If your simulation gets interrupted you may want to restart it. To restart in
the same directory where the simulation was run make sure the fin-kgb.*.mol and
fin-kgb.*.pms files as wall as mt-state.* files are present.
