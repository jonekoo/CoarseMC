This is gbcyl-2.0 A Parallel-tempering constant NPT Metropolis Monte Carlo 
simulation program for a Gay-Berne(4.4, 20.0, 1, 1) model liquid crystal in a 
cylindrical mesocavity.


Compiling
---------

This example is assuming that a bourne shell eg. bash is used. mpi_lib_path
should be the stuff after -L when giving the command mpif90 -show. Here we 
assume that the name of the fortran compiler wrapper including the mpi 
directories is mpif90. LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set to pass the compiler
tests made by the configure script. 

Give the following commands in the shell. To see more options use command
./configure --help

FC=mpif90
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=mpi_lib_path:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure --prefix=yourinstallationpath 
make 
make install

The executable should be now installed to yourinstallationpath/bin/
Example parameter file gbcyl.in and example starting configurations have been 
installed to yourinstallationpath/share/


Usage
-----


A new simulation:

You need the following files:
1. program binary: ptgbcyl
2. parameter file: gbcyl.in
3. file to read the starting configuration from: eg. r9-n1290-cr.gb

Starting configuration file must be the same as set in the parameter file. So 
you may need to edit the parameter file. 

Copy parameter file and starting configuration to the directory where you want 
to run the program and have the program output files.


Running with 8 cores:
mpirun -np 8 ./ptgbcyl


If your simulation gets interrupted you may want to restart it. To restart in
the same directory where the simulation was run set variable is_restart to 
true in gbcyl.in by: 
$is_restart T

Now the parameters will be read from files parameters.out.* written by the last
run. Running the restarted simulation can now be done exactly like a normal 
simulation.
