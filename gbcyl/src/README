This is gbcyl-0.1. A Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation program for a Gay-Berne
(4.4, 20.0, 1, 1) model liquid crystal in a cylindrical nanocavity.


Compiling
---------

To use the program in jovian compile with PGI compiler with the command
make -f Makefile_jovian

For use with other machines you may need to make changes to the makefile. 


Usage
-----


A new simulation:

You need the following files:
1. program binary: eg. gbcyl_jovian
2. parameter file: gbcyl.in
3. file to read the starting configuration from: eg. R9_GB1290.crystal

Starting configuration file must be the same as set in the parameter file. So 
you may need to edit the parameter file. 

Run with:
./gbcyl_jovian


Restarting a simulation: 

You need the following files:
1. program binary: eg. gbcyl_jovian
2. restart file: restart.out

Run with:
./gbcyl_jovian restart [n_equilibration_sweeps n_production_sweeps]


After:

You should have 
1. A new restart file written in place of restart.out. This is updated 
   periodically 
2. simdata.out where the positions and orientations of the molecule and the 
   cylinder dimensions have been written during the simulation.
