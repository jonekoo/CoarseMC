This directory contains a very simple example of point-like particles in a
periodic rectangular box, interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. The
only input file needed is input-0.json, which contains the parameters for the
simulation and the particle coordinates.

Run with:

mpirun -np 1 ../src/ptgbcyl
