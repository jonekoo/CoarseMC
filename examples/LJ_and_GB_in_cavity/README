This example input is for a small number of Xe atoms (LJ particles) dissolved
in a liquid crystal (Gay-Berne particles), confined to a cylindrical cavity. 
It is similar to what was used in the paper

J. Karjalainen, J. Vaara, M. Straka, and P. Lantto. 
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 17:7158â€“7171, 2015.

How to run:

1) Serial simulation

To run the simulation with one core:
mpirun -np 1 ../../src/ptgbcyl


2) Domain decomposition with OpenMP and 4 threads:

To use 4 threads for domain decomposition set the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable
(assuming bash here):

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
mpirun -np 1 ../../src/ptgbcyl


3) Parallel tempering and domain decomposition:

To use two replicas and parallel tempering, with each replica having two
threads:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
mpirun -np 2 ../../src/ptgbcyl


To run a longer simulation, change the parameters n_equilibration_sweeps
and n_production_sweeps in both files input-0.json and input-1.json.
