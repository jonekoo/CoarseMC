This folder contains an example of creating input using the bundled Python 2
scripts and running a simulation for GB particles and LJ atoms. 

To run the scripts and the simulation:
make example

To make this work one must have a working Python 2.6 or 2.7 installation and
have configured the package with:
./configure PYTHON=pathtopython2 [other options]

(and of course compiled after that)
